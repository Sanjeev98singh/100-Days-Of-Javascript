type="text/js"     due to this type attribute js file was not working. If we remove this file then js automatically will start working <------


--------> What does it mean to 'debug' a JavaScript program? And why should we learn to debug our code?

The term debug means to dry run the code before executing the code.
It is the efficient way to execute the code before running the code to get the desired output errorfree. (In simple words reviewing the code before executing) <------

-------> Can you pause a JavaScript program to see what's happening step by step? How?

In JavaScript, "line of execution" refers to the specific line of code currently being executed by the JavaScript engine. It represents the current point in the script where the interpreter is working. <---------

-------> What is a 'breakpoint' in JavaScript debugging?

A "breakpoint" in JavaScript debugging is a marker set in the code that pauses execution at a specific line, allowing us to inspect and analyze the program's state at that point. This helps in understanding and fixing issues in the code. <--------


--------> What are the two main phases of JavaScript code execution?


Parsing Phase and Execution Phase


 Memory Allocation Phase and Execution Phase


Memory Creation Phase and Code Execution Phase   <----------


Initialization Phase and Execution Phase


-------> During the Memory Creation Phase, what happens in JavaScript?


 Variables are assigned values.   


Functions are executed.


Variables and functions are hoisted and memory is allocated.   <-------


Code is parsed and syntax errors are checked.


-------> During the Code Execution Phase, what happens in JavaScript?


Variables are assigned undefined.


 Functions and variables are stored in memory.


 Syntax errors are checked and resolved.


Code is actually executed and values are assigned to variables.   <-------


-------> What is the primary purpose of the defer keyword in a script tag?



To load the script immediately without waiting for the HTML to load.  <-------


To delay the script execution until after the HTML document has been parsed.


To execute the script before the HTML document is parsed.


To defer the execution of the script until all other scripts have been executed.


--------> What is the purpose of the debugger keyword in JavaScript?

stop the execution of the script and display an alert.  


To automatically fix errors in the script.


 To invoke any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. <-----------


To log errors to the console.
